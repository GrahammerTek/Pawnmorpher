        <content>|img:UI/AspectUpdate|Pawnmorpher now has a Discord server! Click 'Link' at the top to join.|&lt;b&gt;WHAT'S NEW?&lt;/b&gt;| - Added &lt;b&gt;iTab&lt;/b&gt; for mutations, which tracks morph influences, production and 'aspects'. Shows up when a pawn gains a mutation.| - Added &lt;b&gt;log entries&lt;/b&gt; for mutations, viewable from the mutation tab.| - Added &lt;b&gt;aspects system&lt;/b&gt;, a mix between hediffs and traits so we don't clutter the health tab. Viewable from the tab.| - Added a &lt;b&gt;new trait&lt;/b&gt; called 'mutation affinity'. Like transhumanist, but for mutations. Also, Body Purists hate being or seeing mutants now.| - Factions &lt;b&gt;will care&lt;/b&gt; if you mutate their people!| - Fur/feather/hide mutations now spread to other parts. |Mech healer serum now also mutates parts it heals.|+ Other various tweaks and bug fixes.|Thank you all for playing and enjoying Pawnmorpher! We'd love to see your unethical madness over on our Discord. :)
