On the modulator, select the newly unlocked option 'merge chambers' (which can still be picked if the two pawns are already mutating) and wait. This option won't show up if there aren't pawns in the chambers.</helpText>

		<helpText>In order to get started with creating Injectors and using Chambers, you'll need to acquire genomes. This can be done via the Tagging Rifle. With a drafted pawn and tagging rifle equipped, select the 'tag animal' widget, and then select the animal you wish to tag. You must have enough Genebank storage to log them. Tagging animals allows you to set them as the end result of a Chamber. You can also obtain genomes by buing Genecards from traders or from completing quests - these must be used at a Genebank to add them to your total storage.</helpText>

		<helpText>To craft injectors, you will need to have the correct genome in your Genebank database. This can be done by collecting animal DNA with the Tagging Rifle's 'Tag' widget (NOT by shooting them with it). Once you have the genome, you will be able to create a bill for the animal at the Injector Workbench.</helpText>

		<helpText>Genebanks store genome information on morphsilk tape-reels. When you tag a creature, you gain its genome, as well as some mutations if that animal has a morph variant. You need enough genebanks to store genomes or else anything you tag won't be stored. You can view and remove genomes in the Genebanks tab at the bottom of the screen.</helpText>

		<helpText>The MCM is the most powerful tool for customising your morphs how you want them. Any mutations you have stored in genebanks can be used in the MCM to apply them to pawns with a specific severity. You can also change the body type and head shape of the pawn and view them from any angle. Confirm your choices and wait for the chamber to apply all mutations to the pawn.</helpText>
