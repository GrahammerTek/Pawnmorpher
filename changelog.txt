Seperated morphs into their own files.
	-This makes it easier to create new morphs and find bugs with existing ones.
	-These files containg the full and partial hediffs, reaction thought, mutations and their injector.
	
Added missing changing thoughts.
	-WolfMorphs, BearMorphs, BoarMorphs and PigMorphs lacked a thought for changing.
	-Feel free to change the descriptions, I just put something that matched pervious thoughts.
	
Added a partial morph parent.
	-This dramatically reduces the number of redundant lines in the xmls.
	
Added partial morphs for Thrumbo, Elephant and Horse.
	-Just did this to maintain consistancy with other morph types.
	-Currently the partial morphs for thrumbo and elephant are unused.
	
Removed the label from partial morph's first (and only) stage.
	-Did this to shorten the hediff's label.
	
Changed all hediffgivers to the a new "HediffGiver_Mutation" class.
	-Has the functionality of many of the old "HeddiffGiver_Esoteric" classes rolled into one.
	-Did this to simplify finding bugs in the future.

Added RatMorph to mutagen stabalizer
	-It, along with the partial BoarMorph, were missing.
	-Added partial Thrumbo and ElephantMorph while I was at it.

Moved hand mutations from reeling stage to the changing stage.
	-If a pawn fully tf'd, there was no chance to see this effect.
	-A smart player could use the mutagen stabalizers to completely ignore this effect.
	-All hands hediffs now only have a 5% chance of occuring to compensate (probably a little low).
	-The partial morphs, which are based on the changing stage, still do not have these hand parts.
	
Changed transforming stage's use to be a warning rather than a bug patch.
	-After Iron Wolf's changes to the HediffGiver_TF class, this stage was no longer necessary.
	-Though as one helpful steam comment noted, there was no "heads up" for when a pawn was about to tf.
	-As a result, the actual tf now happens in the realing stage (as it orignonally did) and the transforming 
		stage is now used as a "grace period" between changing and reeling.

Moved egglayer to the changing stage like the rest of the production morphs.
	-I could not think of a design reason for this inconsitancy, so I changed it.
	
Made EtherWing and EtherWingTip a 5% chance.
	-Just like I did for the other hand changes, but thought I would mention it seperately.
	-This idea is rather unique and I would love more of these for the other morphs.

Changed cow horns and deer antlers to prioritize males.
	-This is similar to how the production mutations prioritze females.
	-I just made sense that males are more likely to have antlers than females.
	-Currently set to 50% on females.
	-Thrumbo horns remain unaffected.
	
Added a elephant hands counterpart to the elephant feet.
	-Noticed some complaints about this in the comments.
	-It made sense to have another hediff for the hands specifically.
	-Added a thought for elaphant hands while I was at it.

Added more tf animals to morphs.
	-BearMorphs can now turn into Bear_Grizzly and Bear_Polar.
	-FoxMorphs can now turn into Fox_Red, Fox_Arctic and Fox_Fennec.
	-WolfMorphs can now turn into Wolf_Timber and Wolf_Arctic.
	
Updated GunshotTf.
	-Changed Transformation-paralysis capmods from -99% moving to max 5% moving
		-It worked incosistantly in the -99% state.
	-Removed the transforming stage (it was no longer necessary).
	-Changed the pawnkinds list to only contain non-powerful morph types (mostly for flavor).
	
Added a negitive thgought for wing tips.
	-Didn't add one for the wing arms though...
	
Made ChaoMorph more like the other morphs.
	-Added a changing thought.
	-Can now give every morph's parts (except the powerful morph parts).
	-FullRandomTF is now treated like a partial morph
	-FullrandomTFAnyOutcome is now treated like a full morph, cinluding transformations.
	-Chaomorph parts have no gender bias.
	
Fixed EtherAntlers not appearing.
	-They were erroniously attached to the jaw part.
	
Changed elephant ears to raise ComfyTemperatureMax.
	-I belive this was the original intention, as the flapping ears cool elephant's bodies.
	-It does make sense for them to lower cold tolerance however, so each ear does so by 2 degrees now.

Changed injector's description to be less generic.
	-now read "A mutagenic injector filled with mechanites and [animal_type] DNA. Use with caution, as leaving the mechanites unchecked may transform the user."
	
Added SerumBase.
	-simplifies the xmls.
	
Changed the descriptions of the serums to be shorter.
	-Now read "A serum filled with mechanites and animal DNA that causes [type] mutations. Use with caution, as leaving the mechanites unchecked may transform the user."
	-Powerful serum remains unchanged.
	
Changed Mutagen stabalizers.
	-Are now considered more of a pill than serum.
	-They now use the perviously unused pill2 graphic rather than penoxycyline.
	-Changed label to "mutapill, stabiliser".
	-Changed description to "These pills will neutralize any active mechanites in the body and prevent mutations for five days."

Changed production cost of the injectors.
	-Normal Injectors now cost 3 mechanite slurry rather than 1.
		-These were cheeper than the random items, It just didn't make sense.
		-Combat and production serums both cost 2 for comparison.
	-Powerful injectors now costs 6 mechanite slurry rather than 1.
		-It didn't make sense for these to be so easily aquireable.
		-Powerful mutaserum costs 5 for comparison.

Changed udderpill's description for the lols.
	-Now reads "A pill to boost production mutations. Side effects may include increased discomfort, hair growth, hunger, coma, and in rare cases, fiery explosions."

Updated ADogSaidPatch to include new chaomelds and fusions.
	-Also removed everything but the chaodino from the tail patch as it's the only one with a tail part def.

Change morph labels from "animalmorph" to "animalMorph"
	-Could I have left it alone? Yes.
	-Should I have left it alone? Yes.
	-Why didn't I? 'cause it looks better that way.
	
Made morphs mutate at the same rate.
	-Jaws have an mtb of 0.5
	-Ears and tails have an mtb of 1
	-Eyes have an mtb of 1.5
	-Limbs have an mtb of 2
	-Hands and feet have an mtb of 3
	-Horns have an mtb of 3


--To-Do--
-add a tutorial for when a pawn is changing.
-add cat and megasloth morphs.
-change category of the mutagen weapons to avoid raiders getting them.
-antler-like changes to things (get better over time).
	-definatly do this with jaws.
-rat needs uses.
-make ether wing add etherwingtip.
-figure out why horsemorph doesn't stabilize.
-seperate BodyAddons into seperate morphs and double check the numbers.
-More useful descriptions?
-remove injectors from drug list and make them not addictive.
