		<description>Golden- or orange-colored wolf eyes with a large, black-ringed iris.  They look striking, especially on a mutated human, but alas they are red-green colorblind.  They also have inferior visual acuity compared to a human's eyes, but they're well adapted to noticing motion.  A morph with these eyes will suffer at most vision-related tasks but once they adapt to the specialized senses they will fare better in melee combat than a baseline human.</description>

                <description>[PAWN_nameDef] now has a striking set of gold-colored wolf eyes.  They're quite intimidating, and thanks to further adaption by the mechanites, have regained tri-color vision.  They're still not quite as good as human eyes at seeing fine details, but in exchange they retain the extra motion sensitivity of wolf eyes combined with the color vision of human ones.  This gives [PAWN_objective] an overwhelming advantage against [PAWN_possessive] prey when hunting.</description>
